Completed **Hacktoberfest 2024**, focusing on infrastructure-level contributions and DevOps tooling.

### 🛠️ Focus Areas
- **Orchestration Tools**: Contributed to workflow automation projects like Kestra.
- **Cloud Infrastructure**: Resolved issues in repositories focused on Kubernetes and Terraform.
- **Project Mentorship**: Helped other contributors navigate complex pull requests and technical documentation.

Building on the experience of previous years, this Hacktoberfest was about giving back to the tools that power my daily workflows.
