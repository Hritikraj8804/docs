The **#100DaysOfCloud** challenge is a structured, hands-on learning journey designed to build real cloud confidence and job-ready skills. By committing to one hands-on task per day for 100 days, I am exploring the deep complexities of cloud platforms.

### 🎯 Learning Objectives
- **Multi-Cloud Expertise**: Understanding how different providers like **AWS** and **Azure** solve infrastructure problems.
- **Hands-on Practice**: Moving beyond theory to build, deploy, and secure cloud resources daily.
- **Public Portfolio**: Documenting every task to showcase my growing expertise in modern cloud architecture.

### 🛠️ Core Topics Explored
- **Infrastructure**: VPC Networking, Subnets, Gateways, and Peering.
- **Compute & Serverless**: EC2, Lambda Functions, and Azure Functions.
- **Storage & Databases**: S3 Buckets, Blob Storage, DynamoDB, and RDS.
- **Security & IAM**: Identity management, MFA, least-privilege roles, and bucket policies.
- **Monitoring & Automation**: CloudWatch, EventBridge, and Infrastructure as Code (Terraform).

This journey is about turning curiosity into practical expertise through daily consistency.
